## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
av <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/avengers/avengers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Part One: Data tidying
```{r}
names(av)
av0 = av %>% filter(Name.Alias != "")
av0 = av0 %>% filter(Name.Alias != "Vance Astrovik")

av1 = av0 %>% gather(key = time, value = death, c(11, 13, 15, 17, 19)) %>%
  select(Name.Alias, time, death) %>% 
  mutate(time = parse_number(time))

av2 = av0 %>% gather(key = time, value = return, c(12, 14, 16, 18, 20)) %>%
  select(Name.Alias, time, return) %>%
  mutate(time = parse_number(time))

av.neat = left_join(av1, av2, by = c("Name.Alias", "time"))
```

## Part two: Validation
**Statement:** Avengers we see on screen — Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and The Vision — every single one of them has died at least once in the course of their time Avenging in the comics.
**Answer:** The table below shows all nine avengers show up at once. 
```{r}
avengers = av.neat %>% filter(Name.Alias %in% c("Anthony Edward \"Tony\" Stark", "Steven Rogers", "Clinton Francis Barton", "Thor Odinson", "Natalia Alianovna Romanova", "Wanda Maximoff", "Pietro Maximoff", "Victor Shade (alias)", "Robert Bruce Banner") & death == "YES")
head(avengers, 9)
```
